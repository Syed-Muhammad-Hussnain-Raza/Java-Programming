# Java Programming Repository (In Working)

This repository is dedicated to solving problems in Java with a focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to build a comprehensive resource for practicing and mastering DSA concepts using Java.

## Repository Overview

This repository is currently in its initial stages. The plan is to gradually add problems and their solutions, organized by different DSA topics.

## Planned Structure

- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees and Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Miscellaneous**

## Getting Started

This section will be updated as the repository evolves. For now, stay tuned for the first set of problems and solutions!

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome once the repository is more developed. Guidelines will be provided at that time.

Stay tuned for updates!
